# Background

Welcome to my workout tracker. This applicatin will track your fitness progress. You can use this to show how many miles you've run or the weight that you have lifted. When you try opening the app again it will take you to your last workout.

# User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
